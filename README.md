Hi, I am Guillermo Hazebrouck. I am an aeronautical enginner and professional programmer.
I mostly program in Ada and .NET.

I am involved in two different open source projects.
One is basically a calculation engine for aerodynamic problems called OpenVOGEL.
The other one is a flight computer for gliders based on Raspberry Pi called G-NAV.

In my professional life I develop real time software for air traffic management.
