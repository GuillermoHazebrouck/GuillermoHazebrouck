Hello, I am an aeronautical engineering dedicated to programming. I own two different open source projects that you can find here on GitHub. One is basically a calculation engine for aerodynamic problems called OpenVGL and the other one is a flight computer for gliders written in Ada called G-NAV.

I hope these projects can be useful for you!
