Hello, I am an aeronautical engineering dedicated to software development. I own two different open source projects that you can find here on GitHub. One is basically a calculation engine for aerodynamic problems called VGL and the other one is a flight computer for glider pilots written in Ada called G-NAV. This last one exists in two flavours: native and web.

I hope these projects can be useful for you!
