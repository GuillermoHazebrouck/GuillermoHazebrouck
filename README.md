Hello, I am an aeronautical engineering dedicated to software development. I own two different open source projects that you can find here on GitHub. One, called VGL, is basically a calculation engine for solving advanced aeromechanic problems in .NET. The other one, called G-NAV, is a flight computer assistant for glider pilots written in Ada. This last one exists in two flavours: native and web.

I hope these projects can be useful for you!
