Hello, I am an aeronautical engineering dedicated to software development. I own two different open source projects that you can find here on GitHub. The oldest one, called VGL, is the continuation of my thesis. It is basically a calculation engine for solving advanced aeromechanical problems, and it is entirely developed in .NET. The other project, called G-NAV, is much more recent. It is a flight computer assistant for glider pilots written in Ada. This last one exists in two flavours: native and web. They come with exclusive graphics library mounted on OpenGL/WebGL.

I hope these projects can be useful for you as well! I appreciate your feedback.
