Hello, I am Guillermo Hazebrouck. I am an aeronautical engineering dedicated to programming. I am involved in two different open source projects that I have created. One is basically a calculation engine for aerodynamic problems called OpenVOGEL. The other one is a flight computer for gliders written in Ada called G-NAV.

I hope you enjoy these projects.
