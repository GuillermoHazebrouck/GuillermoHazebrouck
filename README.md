Hello, I am Guillermo Hazebrouck. I was born and raced in Argentina, where I studied aeronautical engineering. I started programming in the frame of numerical computations for flight mechanics, and soon after I became software developer.
I used to program a lot in .NET, but now I mostly program in Ada. I am involved in two different open source projects that I have created.
One is basically a calculation engine for aerodynamic problems called OpenVOGEL.
The other one is a flight computer for gliders based written in Ada called G-NAV.

In my professional life I develop real time software for air traffic management.

If you have questions about my projects or whatever, you can reach me via email to gahazebrouck@gmail.com
